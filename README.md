## Mods

### BetterCustomerPerformance

Significantly improves the performance when there are a lot of customers.

This is done by capping the queue size to 30, which can potentially affect some
calculations. From testing, there doesn't seem to be any noticeable changes in
gameplay.

### ShowUpgrade

Shows the next possible upgrade(s) for a blueprint in the popup.

### Core

Allows CamPizza mods to fully function. Not an actual mod.
